deprecated_features:
    - paramiko connection plugin, configuration items in the global scope are being deprecated and will be removed in favor or the existing same options in the plugin itself.
      Users should not need to change anything (how to configure them are the same) but plugin authors using the global constants should move to using the plugin's get_option().
