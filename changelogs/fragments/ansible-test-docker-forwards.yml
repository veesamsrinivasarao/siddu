bugfixes:
- ansible-test - Properly detect docker host when using ``ssh://`` protocol for connecting to the docker daemon.
- ansible-test - Explicitly supply ``ControlPath=none`` when setting up port forwarding over SSH to address
  the scenario where the local ssh configuration uses ``ControlPath`` for all hosts, and would prevent
  ports to be forwarded after the initial connection to the host.
